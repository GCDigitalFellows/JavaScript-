Introduction: Javascript - 
	- JavaScript is a scripting language, created for making html-pages interactive.
	- JavaScript has nothing in common with Java. It is a completely different language with a similar naming. 
	- Programs in JavaScript are called scripts. They need no compilation, you just write a script, append it to HTML-page and it works.

	- Create basic HTML page
	- Internal element: use <script>
    alert('Hello, World!')
  	</script>  to create basic interactive alert 
  	- Note that contents of the SCRIPT block is not shown, instead, it is executed.

	Code structure
	- Statements are separated by a semicolon.
	- Spaces and tabs are ignored, so one-lining is possible:
	alert('Hello');   alert('World!');
	- But newlines are not ignored. Instead, a newline may separate statements, just like semicolons do.
		These two lines are fully equivalent:
		a = 5
		a = 5;
	- A backslash before a line break forces the interpreter to ignore the newline.
	- The // sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.
		// This is a comment that the computer will ignore. 
		// It is for your eyes only!

 	Use console to try these out -

 	- confirm('This is a message from The Singularity');
	- These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users. You've probably seen them pop up when you try to delete important things or leave a website with unsaved changes.

	- You can ask for input with a prompt.
	- prompt("what is your deal, dude?")


 	- Variables and data
 	- Doing math
 	- Logic
 	- Conditional 
 	- Looping 
 	- Functions 
 	- Objects 
 	- Arrays
